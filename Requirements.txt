# This project primarily uses Python's standard libraries:
# - curses
# - subprocess
# - ipaddress
# - logging
# - time
# - os

# No external Python packages are required.

# However, if you plan to run this project on Windows, you need to install the `windows-curses` package
# to provide support for the curses library.
